  A finite formalization of the finite part of the hard-sphere NBC
  proof.  `points` is a finite configuration ledger, `trees` is a finite list
  of candidate spanning trees, and `region t x` is the NBC ownership test.

  The central theorem is a literal finite Tonelli/double-counting proof:

      sum_x weight(x) * NBCMultiplicity(x)
        = sum_t NBCRegionWeight(t).

  No measure theorem, graph theorem, or opaque assumption is imported here.  The
  continuous hard-sphere interpretation is obtained by replacing the finite
  weight sum with Lebesgue integration after this algebraic identity.

  This is the finite active-graph restriction used before the NBC step.  The
  list `graphs` represents the complete finite list of edge subsets.  A Mayer
  term is zero unless every edge is active; otherwise its product is the
  parity sign of the number of edges.

  The next block formalizes the sign-reversing part independently of graph
  representation.  For a fixed ordered graph, `all` is the finite list of
  connected edge sets, `good` is the finite list of NBC trees, and `badPairs`
  is produced by the least broken-circuit toggle described in the TeX proof.
  The theorem checks, in the kernel, that every paired bad contribution
  disappears.
